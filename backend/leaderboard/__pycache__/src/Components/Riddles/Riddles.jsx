  { question: "Two metal fighters, bold and fast,Clashing hard, will one outlast? Sparks may fly, but strength will score, What’s this battle of bots at war? " },
  { question: "No legs to run, no hands to throw, Yet they chase the ball with a perfect flow. One goal to win, the crowd stands tall, What’s this game of bots and ball ?" },
  { question: "Through the water, swift and true, A bot must race, cutting through.A maze to solve, no time to waste,   What’s this challenge of speed and grace?" },
  { question: "A twisting path beneath the waves, A racer glides, the time it craves. No human hands, just code and speed, What’s this race where bots take the lead?" },
  { question: "Through dirt and dust, we make our mark, With roaring speed, we ignite the spark. Built for the rough, ready to soar,Which team conquers and asks for more?" },
  { question: "Bouncing high on rugged ground, Through mud and rocks, we tear around. Built to endure, wild and free, What’s this beast of off-road speed?" },
  {
    question:
      "A tiny bot, so quick and bright, Through walls and turns, it finds the light. Four big mazes, time runs fast, What’s this race where brains outlast?",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Left or right, which way to go? A thinking bot must always know. Find the path and beat the clock,What’s this game of brain and stock?",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Engines tuned, the race is near, Gears and bolts, no room for fear. Fix, refine, make it right, What’s this stop before the flight?",
  },
  { question: "Where torque meets skill and engines hum, A home for speed, where builders come. Machines are prepped to rule the way,What’s this zone where motors stay?" },
